Technical Considerations for Building TextBuddy

1️⃣ Tech Stack

For TextBuddy, a floating AI text assistant available on both web and mobile, the following tech stack is recommended:

Frontend (UI & Widget)

✅ Web (Browser Extension + Web App)
	•	React + Next.js → Ensures fast rendering for AI suggestions and SEO-friendly landing pages.
	•	Tailwind CSS → Speeds up UI development with a modern, responsive design.
	•	Manifest V3 (Chrome Extension API) → For browser extension compatibility (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

✅ Mobile (Floating Assistant)
	•	React Native → Single codebase for iOS & Android floating widget implementation.
	•	Expo → Simplifies app deployment and maintenance.

Backend (AI Processing & User Data Storage)
	•	Node.js + Express → Handles API requests efficiently for real-time AI text suggestions.
	•	MongoDB (for user data) + Redis (for caching AI requests) → Optimizes performance and reduces latency.
	•	WebSockets (Socket.io) → Enables real-time AI text feedback.

AI Model & Processing
	•	OpenAI API / Claude / Groq API → For text rewriting & correction features.
	•	LangChain → To build a custom AI flow for user text interactions.

2️⃣ Scalability

To ensure TextBuddy remains fast as user demand increases, the following scalability strategies are recommended:

1️⃣ Horizontal Scaling
	•	Deploy microservices architecture with AWS Lambda or Dockerized Node.js servers for scaling AI requests.
	•	Use NGINX load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple backend instances.

2️⃣ Caching & Optimization
	•	Implement Redis caching for frequently requested AI responses.
	•	Use Edge Computing (Cloudflare Workers) to reduce response time for users globally.

3️⃣ Key Integrations

✅ Authentication
	•	OAuth (Google, GitHub, Microsoft Login) → Allows seamless signup and integration into existing workflows.
	•	Clerk/Auth0 → Simplifies secure user authentication with session management.

✅ Payments & Subscriptions
	•	Stripe → Enables seamless billing for Pro/Enterprise plans.
	•	Paddle (Alternative for SaaS) → Handles taxes and global payments automatically.

✅ AI Model Selection
	•	OpenAI API, Claude, or Groq → Allows integration with different AI models for text suggestions.
	•	Fine-tuned LLM (Later Stage) → For custom AI optimization based on user feedback.
